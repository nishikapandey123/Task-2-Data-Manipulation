This project is a simple Flask application that demonstrates data manipulation in Python using Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

- templates/: Folder containing HTML templates.
  - index.html: HTML file to display the output.
- static/: Folder containing static files (CSS and JavaScript).

4. Open your web browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) to view the output.

## Project Details

- The app.py file contains the Flask application logic.
- The templates/index.html file defines the HTML structure.
- The static/style.css file contains styles for the HTML elements.
- The static/script.js file handles data manipulation and appends content to the HTML page.

## Data Manipulation
